【CountDownLatch】
构造函数：
public CountDownLatch(int count) {
        if (count < 0) throw new IllegalArgumentException("count < 0");
        this.sync = new Sync(count);
    }
创建了一个Sync对象，Sync的定义：
private static final class Sync extends AbstractQueuedSynchronizer {
        private static final long serialVersionUID = 4982264981922014374L;

        Sync(int count) {
            setState(count);
        }

        int getCount() {
            return getState();
        }
        
	//被await()方法调用，如果state已经被减到1了就返回，否则doAcquireSharedInterruptibly内部会一直循环检查
        protected int tryAcquireShared(int acquires) {
            return (getState() == 0) ? 1 : -1;
        }

	//被countDown()方法调用,每次把state减1
        protected boolean tryReleaseShared(int releases) {
            // Decrement count; signal when transition to zero
            for (;;) {
                int c = getState();
                if (c == 0)
                    return false;
                int nextc = c-1;
                if (compareAndSetState(c, nextc))
                    return nextc == 0;
            }
        }
    }
 
关键方法逻辑：
public void await() throws InterruptedException {
        sync.acquireSharedInterruptibly(1);
    }

public void countDown() {
        sync.releaseShared(1);
    }

/**
         * Status field, taking on only the values:
         *   SIGNAL:     The successor of this node is (or will soon be)
         *               blocked (via park), so the current node must
         *               unpark its successor when it releases or
         *               cancels. To avoid races, acquire methods must
         *               first indicate they need a signal,
         *               then retry the atomic acquire, and then,
         *               on failure, block.
         *   CANCELLED:  This node is cancelled due to timeout or interrupt.
         *               Nodes never leave this state. In particular,
         *               a thread with cancelled node never again blocks.
         *   CONDITION:  This node is currently on a condition queue.
         *               It will not be used as a sync queue node
         *               until transferred, at which time the status
         *               will be set to 0. (Use of this value here has
         *               nothing to do with the other uses of the
         *               field, but simplifies mechanics.)
         *   PROPAGATE:  A releaseShared should be propagated to other
         *               nodes. This is set (for head node only) in
         *               doReleaseShared to ensure propagation
         *               continues, even if other operations have
         *               since intervened.
         *   0:          None of the above
         *
